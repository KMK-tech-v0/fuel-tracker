## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Navigate to database folder
cd database

# Run database creation script in SQL Server Management Studio or sqlcmd
sqlcmd -S "YOUR_SERVER_NAME" -E -i "create_database.sql"
sqlcmd -S "YOUR_SERVER_NAME" -E -i "insert_sample_data.sql"
sqlcmd -S "YOUR_SERVER_NAME" -E -i "forecasting_procedures.sql"
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend folder
cd backend

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Update database connection in config.py if needed
# Default: DESKTOP-17P73P0\SQLEXPRESS

# Run the application
python app.py
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend

# Add your logo images to assets/ folder:
# - logo.png (header logo)
# - footer-logo.gif (footer logo/animation)

# Open index.html in a web browser or serve via HTTP server
# For development, you can use Python's built-in server:
python -m http.server 8080
```

## üéØ Usage

### Dashboard

- Create scenario planning for different consumption rates
- Adjust safety factors for risk management

### Operational Hours Logging
- Log equipment running hours daily
- Automatic consumption calculation based on equipment rates
- Track fuel efficiency and equipment performance
- Generate maintenance alerts

### Stock Management
- Real-time stock level monitoring
- Automatic reorder point alerts
- Fill percentage visualization
- Stock status tracking (Normal/Low/Critical/High)

### Equipment Management
- Register equipment with consumption rates
- Track equipment by site and fuel type
- Monitor equipment efficiency
- Maintenance scheduling

## üîß Configuration

### Database Connection
Update `backend/config.py`:
```python
DB_SERVER = 'YOUR_SQL_SERVER_INSTANCE'
DB_NAME = 'FuelControlV2'
```

### System Settings
Modify settings via database or API:
- Default safety factor for forecasting
- Alert thresholds and notification settings
- Calculation frequencies
- Email notification configuration

## üìä API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - System health check
- `GET /api/sites` - Get all sites
- `GET /api/equipment` - Get equipment list
- `GET /api/stock` - Get current stock levels

### Forecasting Endpoints
- `GET /api/forecasts` - Get consumption forecasts
- `POST /api/forecasts/calculate` - Calculate new forecasts
- `POST /api/forecasts/scenarios` - Create forecast scenarios

### Operational Endpoints
- `GET /api/operational-hours` - Get operational hours log
- `POST /api/operational-hours` - Log equipment hours
- `GET /api/alerts` - Get system alerts

## üö® Alerts & Notifications

### Alert Types
- **Low Stock Alerts** - When fuel levels drop below thresholds
- **Forecast Shortage Alerts** - When projected shortage is detected
- **Equipment Efficiency Alerts** - When consumption deviates from expected
- **Maintenance Due Alerts** - When equipment maintenance is required

### Configuration
Alerts can be configured per site, fuel type, or equipment with:
- Custom threshold values
